      "These stunning marbled cookies are easier to make than you might think. All that's needed to achieve the look is to separate part of the dough and add just a few drops of food coloring gel.

If you'd like, have fun with different colors of sanding sugar for the sparkle element or experiment with other colors for the marbled look.",
